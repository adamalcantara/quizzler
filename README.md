# Quizzler

## Description

I continued my journey of learning Flutter with this project, in which I created a quiz game which takes in a user's input of true or false and checks if they selected the correct answer. I learned quite a bit while creating this project, including separating private functionality into a different file, lists, and boolean operators. I also used the package rFlutter Alert to create an alert when the user reaches the end of the quiz.
